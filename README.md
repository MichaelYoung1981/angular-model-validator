angular-model-validator
=======================

A simple directive to allow models to be validated on submission rather than relying on form validation.

You can find more information, including the rationale for creating this directive, on my blog: [https://northerncodemonkey.wordpress.com](https://northerncodemonkey.wordpress.com)

```
bower install angular-model-validator
